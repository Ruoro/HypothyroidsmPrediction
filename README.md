Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Using the healthcare datasets provided the following tasks were accomplished:  

-Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.
The models created and tested include:
- Base Model (Linear Regression)
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boost Model 
- SVM model
- Polunomial Kernel
- Sigmound kernel 
- RBF kernel model 

The models were trained and tested on the data and the accuracy metrics for all the models compared.
